### Now let's get into the branding
Everything is here on GitHub. 


In the folder meat, you will find the following goodies:

    * projectsegfault1.kra (this is the base design)
    * projectsegfault1_gimp.xcf (this is where we applied the line-arty effect)
    * projectsegfault1.png (this is the Krita export, that is used in projectsegfault1_gimp.xcf)
    * projectsegfault1_gimp.png (this is the final logo)
    * projectsegfault1_wallpaper.png (This is a quickly-made 1080p wallpaper of our logo. It looks rather good!)
# who made the logo? I hate it and I'd like to shout at the guy behind this. Or, I like this and I'd like to praise the guy behind this.
Odyssey346 designed these logos quickly in GIMP and Krita.

# Branding Guidelines
Please do not use the line-arty version of our logo where it would not look good or readable. (the final logo)
